# FizzBuzz test
This a test for coder.<br /><br />
The test says: <br /><br />
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.<br /><br />
Apparently you have to do it in less than 10 minutes. I failed... Guess am too old :-( <br /><br />
Anyway, this my solution. Built in Swift 5.0...
